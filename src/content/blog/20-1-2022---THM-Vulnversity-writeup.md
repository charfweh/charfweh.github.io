## Abstract

Vulnversity is a TryHackMe room where we apply active recon with web app attacks to do privilege escalation

## Tryhackme

THM room: [Vulnversity](https://tryhackme.com/room/vulnversity)</br>
Level: Easy

## Challenge

- user flag
- root flag

## Reconnaissance

As with anything, we'll firstly use nmap for reconn

### port scanning

we will identify services running and open ports vulnerable to exploit
let's run it
`nmap -sV -sC -oN nmapresults.file 10.10.103.159`
![nmapreconn.png](/assets/thm-vuln/nmapreconn.png)
sV for enumuerate versions
sC for default scripts
oN for output format

we see that the server is exposing port 3333 for a website
Lets check it out in the browser

## Enumerate web

The website looks like a generic university portal more like VULNVERSITY :D alright lets run dirbuster aka `dirb` to check for any hidden directories

```
dirb http://10.10.103.159:3333/ /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -o dirbbrute
```

![vuln-dirbbrute](/assets/thm-vuln/vuln-dirbbrute.png)
Among regular dirs, we see one that stands out and its `internal`, if we navigate to the page, we get an upload file page.

## Filter bypass

Checking the upload page, we see that `jpeg` is allowed and we cant outright upload our `.php` reverse shell, what we do now is to check for extensions that are allowed
Thanks to thm, they gave us a wordlist to try
![vuln-phpextensions](/assets/thm-vuln/vuln-phpextensions.png)
Now make sure burp is configured, we are going to intercept the request, send it to the intruder and we select payload as sniper and add extension field to be enumerated as shown below
![vuln-payloadpositions](/assets/thm-vuln/vuln-payloadpositions.png)

lets load the extension file from `payloads` tab
![vuln-phplist](/assets/thm-vuln/vuln-phplist.png)
out of these extensions, the response length for `.phtml` stands out

## Reverse shell

_what is a reverse shell? its basically code written to make an outbound connection to our machine and pop a shell for us_
now we need to just locate the shell, its there in `/internal/uploads`. before we pop a shell, set up a netcat listener on attacking machine `nc -lvnp [port]`

### user flag

navigating to the file we get a shell and finally our first flag `user.txt` at `/home/bill/user.txt`
![vuln-userflag](/assets/thm-vuln/vuln-userflag.png)

## Privilege Escalation

Now that we've compromised the machine, lets escalate our privileges and become root. A common technique is to check for `SUID binaries` for privesc. So how do we check?
**find / -user root -perm` `-4000` `-exec ls -ldb {} \;**
out of the huge output `systemctl` stands out, great now we'll take help from our good friend `gtfobins` for `systemctl`, as we see and I quote **If the binary is allowed to run as superuser by** sudo **it does not drop the elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system,escalate or maintain privileged access.**
Okay good lets try the payload

```bash
TF=$(mktemp).service
echo '[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "cat /root/root.txt > /tmp/output"
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target' > $TF
/bin/systemctl link $TF
/bin/systemctl enable --now $TF
```

what we're essentially doing is making a service called `TF` then making it execute whats in `ExecStart` and at last, linking and enable the service `TF`.

### root flag

pasting the payload and `cat-ing` the `/tmp/output` we get the last and final flag `root.txt`

Thanks for reading!!
